# Chrome extension for a blog ([Blog](jspark.me))

## Motivation

I used to scrap some articles to read later.  But it is not easy to collect all and categorize. I had saved items by using 'Pocket' and 'Evernote' in Web and put code snippets into 'Quiver.' It's so messy!

I decided to make my blog and chrome extension for putting all together into only one storage.
